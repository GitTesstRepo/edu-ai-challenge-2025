I am testing my application. I found a bug "Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.". 
Create a clear and well-structured bug ticket adapted into a Jira-compatible issue format. The output should follow this format:
- Title
- Description
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected vs Actual Behavior
- Environment (leave placeholders if unknown)
- Severity or Impact
The result should be adapted for saving as md-extension file.

Initially operating a short route between Waterford and London Gatwick, it expanded rapidly throughout the 1990s and 2000s, pioneering the low-cost carrier (LCC) model in Europe. Key milestones include the launch of its website in 2000, introduction of the “no-frills” business model, and aggressive expansion across Europe, becoming one of the largest airlines by passenger numbers.

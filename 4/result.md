### üë®‚Äçüíª **1. Experienced Developer Review**

**Observations:**

* ‚úÖ **Clarity & Readability:** The function is clear and easy to read. The loop and user map creation are straightforward.
* ‚úÖ **Structure:** The function maintains single responsibility ‚Äì transforming input data.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Naming:** `processUserData` is acceptable, but it could be more specific like `normalizeUserData` or `extractActiveUserMetadata` to reflect intent more clearly.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Magic String:** `"status" == "active"` is a hard-coded convention; consider using constants to avoid errors if the string changes elsewhere.
* ‚úÖ **Idiomatic Go:** The code uses Go features (slices, maps, interface{}) idiomatically.

**Recommendations:**

* **Use constants** for repeated string literals:

  ```go
  const (
      StatusKey   = "status"
      ActiveState = "active"
  )
  ```
* **Consider adding type safety** if the `data` structure is known. Using structs instead of maps improves maintainability and avoids type assertions.

### üîê **2. Security Engineer Review**

**Observations:**

* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Lack of Input Validation:** The function assumes all expected keys (`"id"`, `"name"`, `"email"`, `"status"`) exist and are of correct types in the input map. This can lead to runtime panics or malformed outputs.
* ‚ùå **No Error Handling:** If fields are missing or have unexpected types, there‚Äôs no safeguard or logging to detect/handle this.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential Data Exposure:** The `fmt.Println` statement prints the number of processed users. Depending on context, logging data or counts might inadvertently expose system behavior to attackers.

**Recommendations:**

* **Validate input fields** to ensure they exist and are of the correct type:

  ```go
  id, ok := data[i]["id"].(string)
  if !ok {
      // log or skip
      continue
  }
  ```
* **Avoid verbose logging** in production or sensitive environments, or use a logging framework with configurable levels (e.g., debug, info).
* **Avoid trusting external map\[string]interface{} structures blindly**. Consider sanitizing or deep-copying to avoid mutation attacks if data originates from untrusted sources.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **3. Performance Specialist Review**

**Observations:**

* ‚úÖ **Linear Time Complexity:** The function operates in O(n) time, which is optimal for the task.
* ‚úÖ **Memory Use is Reasonable:** It creates a new slice of the same size as the input, which is expected.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è **Slice Initialization Optimization:** The `users` slice is grown with `append` in a loop. Since the final size is known (`len(data)`), pre-allocating the slice would improve performance and reduce heap allocations.

**Recommendations:**

* **Preallocate the `users` slice**:

  ```go
  users := make([]map[string]interface{}, 0, len(data))
  ```

  This minimizes reallocations as the slice grows.

* If performance becomes a bottleneck:

  * Consider using a struct instead of `map[string]interface{}` for faster access and lower memory usage.
  * Benchmark transformation logic under real data load using Go‚Äôs `testing` package with `b.N`.
